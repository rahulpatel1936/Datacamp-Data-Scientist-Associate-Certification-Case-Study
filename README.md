This publication demonstrates my proficiency with handling a typical business problem using R. I performed <b>exploratory data analysis</b>, generated <b>visualizations (e.g., stacked bar plots, raincloud plots, tree diagrams)</b>, and performed <b>statistical/machine learning analyses</b>; namely, binary logistic regresission and decision tree models. After generating these models, I asssessed their <b>performance</b>, compared them, and came to a conclusion as to which model business stakeholders should implement.
